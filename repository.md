## Pull Requests:
1. Work with task in `feat/<task-name>` branch.
2. When task is done then:
```sh
git pull origin dev  # Receive latest version of dev branch
# Resolve possible conflicts
git push --set-upstream origin feat/<task-name>  # Push your task
```
3. Do not use `git rebase` with already merged commits.
4. Make a PR from `feat/<your-task>` to `dev` branch. Write a description. Example:
```
Task: [Task name](https://github.com/prozhito/utils/issues/1)

5. Pull Request is a place to discuss code. Be cultural, respect each other's time and work.
6. PR must be approved by team leader or at least one of your team mates.
7. Merge your PR using `squash` to reduce number of commits and each of them will contain its own specific task.

## PR should not contain:
- Commented code.
- Unused modules.
- Extra files.
- Autogenerated code, node_modules folder, system files, etc. (use .gitignore for such cases)
